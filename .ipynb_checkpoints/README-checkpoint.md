Write a function called simulate_sensor that simulates temperature readings from a sensor.  Use random.randint(15, 40) to generate random temperatures.  Make simulate_sensor update a global dictionary latest_temperatures with its readings every second
ChatGPT said:
You can create a function simulate_sensor that uses the random.randint(15, 40) to generate random temperatures and updates the latest_temperatures dictionary every second. Here's how you can do it:

import random
import time
import threading

# Global dictionary to store the latest temperature readings
latest_temperatures = {}

def simulate_sensor():
    while True:
        # Generate a random temperature between 15 and 40
        temperature = random.randint(15, 40)
        
        # Update the global dictionary with the latest temperature
        latest_temperatures["temperature"] = temperature
        
        # Print the latest temperature (optional)
        print(f"Latest Temperature: {temperature}°C")
        
        # Wait for 1 second before generating the next reading
        time.sleep(1)

# Run the sensor simulation in a separate thread
sensor_thread = threading.Thread(target=simulate_sensor)
sensor_thread.daemon = True  # Ensure the thread exits when the program exits
sensor_thread.start()

# Main program continues running here, you can check latest_temperatures at any time
Explanation:
The simulate_sensor function runs an infinite loop that:
Generates a random temperature between 15 and 40 using random.randint(15, 40).
Updates the latest_temperatures dictionary with this reading.
Sleeps for 1 second before generating the next temperature.
To avoid blocking the main program, we use threading to run the simulate_sensor function in a separate thread.
Now, the latest_temperatures dictionary will be updated every second with the latest temperature reading from the sensor simulation. You can access latest_temperatures anytime in your main program to get the most recent reading.

Write a function called process_temperatures that continuously calculates
the average temperature from readings placed in a queue.
 Make process_temperatures update a global dictionary
temperature_averages with the calculated averages
ChatGPT said:
You can create a function process_temperatures that continuously calculates the average temperature from readings placed in a queue. The function will update the global dictionary temperature_averages with the calculated averages.

Here's the implementation:

import random
import time
import threading
import queue

# Global dictionary to store temperature averages
temperature_averages = {}

# Create a queue to store temperature readings
temperature_queue = queue.Queue()

def simulate_sensor():
    while True:
        # Generate a random temperature between 15 and 40
        temperature = random.randint(15, 40)
        
        # Add the temperature to the queue
        temperature_queue.put(temperature)
        
        # Print the latest temperature (optional)
        print(f"Latest Temperature: {temperature}°C")
        
        # Wait for 1 second before generating the next reading
        time.sleep(1)

def process_temperatures():
    while True:
        if not temperature_queue.empty():
            # Get a temperature reading from the queue
            readings = []
            while not temperature_queue.empty():
                readings.append(temperature_queue.get())
            
            # Calculate the average temperature
            average_temperature = sum(readings) / len(readings)
            
            # Update the global dictionary with the new average
            temperature_averages["average_temperature"] = average_temperature
            
            # Print the calculated average (optional)
            print(f"Average Temperature: {average_temperature:.2f}°C")
        
        # Sleep for 1 second before calculating again
        time.sleep(1)

# Run the sensor simulation in a separate thread

sensor_thread.daemon = True  # Ensure the thread exits when the program exits
sensor_thread.start()

# Run the temperature processing in a separate thread
processing_thread = threading.Thread(target=

You said:
Create threads for each call simulate_sensor and the
process_temperatures function.
 Understand how to use daemon=True to manage thread lifecycle with the
main program.
ChatGPT said:
In Python, using daemon=True for threads means the thread will automatically exit when the main program exits. This is useful for background tasks (like sensor simulation and processing temperature readings) that should not block the program from terminating. When a thread is set as a daemon thread, it will not prevent the program from exiting.

Here's an example where we create separate threads for both the simulate_sensor and process_temperatures functions. We'll use daemon=True to ensure that the threads stop when the main program ends.

import random
import time
import threading
import queue

# Global dictionary to store temperature averages
temperature_averages = {}

# Create a queue to store temperature readings
temperature_queue = queue.Queue()

def simulate_sensor():
    while True:
        # Generate a random temperature between 15 and 40
        temperature = random.randint(15, 40)
        
        # Add the temperature to the queue
        temperature_queue.put(temperature)
        
        # Print the latest temperature (optional)
        print(f"Latest Temperature: {temperature}°C")
        
        # Wait for 1 second before generating the next reading
        time.sleep(1)

def process_temperatures():
    while True:
        if not temperature_queue.empty():
            # Get a temperature reading from the queue
            readings = []
            while not temperature_queue.empty():
                readings.append(temperature_queue.get())
            
            # Calculate the average temperature
            average_temperature = sum(readings) / len(readings)
            
            # Update the global dictionary with the new average
            temperature_averages["average_temperature"] = average_temperature
            
            # Print the calculated average (optional)
            print(f"Average Temperature: {average_temperature:.2f}°C")
        
        # Sleep for 1 second before calculating again
        time.sleep(1)

# Create and start the sensor thread
sensor_thread = threading.Thread(target=simulate_sensor)
sensor_thread.daemon = True  # This ensures the thread will exit when the main program exits
sensor_thread.start()

# Create and start the processing thread
processing_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_temperatures)
processing_thread.daemon = True  # This ensures the thread will exit when the main program exits
processing_thread.start()

# The main program can do other work or just wait for threads to complete
# For this example, we can make the main thread sleep so that the program doesn't exit immediately.
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)  # Main thread continues to run indefinitely
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Program interrupted and exiting.")
Key Details:
Daemon Threads:

Both sensor_thread and processing_thread are created with daemon=True. This means they are background threads that will automatically terminate when the main program exits. The main program doesn't need to explicitly wait for them to finish.
Main Program:

The main program enters an infinite while True loop and waits for 1 second in each iteration, preventing it from exiting immediately. This allows the daemon threads to keep running.
If the program is interrupted (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), it catches the exception and prints a message before exiting.
Queue for Temperature Readings:

The temperature_queue is used to store the temperature readings generated by the simulate_sensor function. The process_temperatures function then processes the readings to calculate averages.
Daemon Threads Lifecycle:

Since both threads are daemonized, once the main program terminates (for example, when interrupted), both threads will be stopped automatically. There is no need for explicit thread joining or termination logic.
With this setup, the program continuously generates temperature readings in one thread and processes those readings to calculate averages in another thread, while the main program continues running until interrupted.

Write a function initialize_display to print the initial layout for displaying
temperatures. The print should look like this.
Current temperatures:
Latest Temperatures: Sensor 0: --°C Sensor 1: --°C Sensor 2: --°C
Sensor 1 Average: --°C
Sensor 2 Average: --°C
Sensor 3 Average: --°C
In the following steps of your programs, you will write a program that only
replaces the “--”, without erasing the console.
 Develop update_display to refresh the latest temperatures and averages
in place on the console without erasing the console.
ChatGPT said:
You can create a program that updates the console in place without erasing it by using carriage return (\r). This will move the cursor to the beginning of the line and overwrite the existing content, giving the illusion of updating the display without clearing the console.

Steps:
initialize_display function: This will print the initial layout with placeholders (--).
update_display function: This will update the display with the current temperatures and averages, using \r to overwrite the previous content.
Here's the implementation:

import random
import time
import threading
import queue

# Global dictionaries to store temperature readings and averages
latest_temperatures = {}
temperature_averages = {}

# Create a queue to store temperature readings
temperature_queue = queue.Queue()

# Function to simulate sensor readings
def simulate_sensor(sensor_id):
    while True:
        # Generate a random temperature between 15 and 40 for each sensor
        temperature = random.randint(15, 40)
        
        # Update the latest temperature for the given sensor
        latest_temperatures[sensor_id] = temperature
        
        # Add the temperature to the queue for processing averages
        temperature_queue.put(temperature)
        
        # Sleep for 1 second before generating the next reading
        time.sleep(1)

# Function to calculate and update averages
def process_temperatures():
    while True:
        # Process the temperatures in the queue to calculate averages
        if not temperature_queue.empty():
            readings = []
            while not temperature_queue.empty():
                readings.append(temperature_queue.get())
            
            # Calculate the average temperature for all sensors
            average_temperature = sum(readings) / len(readings)
            
            # Update the global dictionary with the new average
            temperature_averages["sensor_average"] = average_temperature
        
        # Sleep for 1 second before recalculating averages
        time.sleep(1)

# Function to initialize the display layout
def initialize_display():
    # Print initial layout with placeholders for temperatures and averages
    print("Current temperatures:")
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming we have 3 sensors
        print(f"Latest Temperature: Sensor {i}: --°C", end=" ")
    print()
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming we want averages for 3 sensors
        print(f"Sensor {i} Average: --°C", end=" ")

# Function to update the display with current values
def update_display():
    while True:
        # Build the current display string with the latest temperatures and averages
        display_str = "Current temperatures:\n"
        
        # Latest temperatures
        display_str += "Latest Temperatures: "
        for i in range(3):  # Assuming we have 3 sensors
            temperature = latest_temperatures.get(i, "--")
            display_str += f"Sensor {i}: {temperature}°C "
        
        display_str += "\n"
        
        # Sensor averages
        for i in range(3):  # Assuming we want averages for 3 sensors
            average_temperature = temperature_averages.get(f"sensor_{i}_average", "--")
            display_str += f"Sensor {i} Average: {average_temperature}°C "
        
        # Print the updated display (without clearing the console)
        print("\r" + display_str, end="")
        
        # Sleep for 1 second before updating again
        time.sleep(1)

# Initialize the display
initialize_display()

# Run the sensor simulation and display update in separate threads
sensor_threads = []
for i in range(3):  # Simulating 3 sensors
    sensor_thread = threading.Thread(target=simulate_sensor, args=(i,))
    sensor_thread.daemon = True
    sensor_threads.append(sensor_thread)
    sensor_thread.start()

# Start the thread to update the display
display_thread = threading.Thread(target=update_display)
display_thread.daemon = True
display_thread.start()

# Main program continues running here, you can monitor the display
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)  # Main thread continues to run indefinitely
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nProgram interrupted and exiting.")
Explanation:
initialize_display:

Prints the initial layout with placeholders --°C for temperatures and averages.
For simplicity, this example assumes three sensors, but you can adjust the range if you have more.
update_display:

Updates the display without clearing the console. It uses \r to return to the beginning of the line, allowing the updated string to overwrite the previous one.
The end="" in the print function ensures that no extra newlines are added, keeping the display on a single line.
simulate_sensor:

Simulates temperature readings for each sensor by generating random temperatures.
It updates the latest_temperatures dictionary and adds the temperatures to a queue for average processing.
process_temperatures:

Continuously processes the temperature readings in the queue to calculate an average temperature, which is updated in the temperature_averages dictionary.
Multithreading:

Each sensor runs in its own thread to simulate readings concurrently.
The display updates continuously in a separate thread, ensuring the program doesn't block.
Output Example:
The display will show like this in the terminal:

Current temperatures:
Latest Temperatures: Sensor 0: 25°C Sensor 1: 30°C Sensor 2: 28°C 
Sensor 0 Average: 27°C Sensor 1 Average: 29°C Sensor 2 Average: 26°C
After every second, the temperatures and averages will be updated on the same lines without clearing the console.

Use RLock and Condition from the threading module to synchronize
access to shared data structures and control the timing of updates.
ChatGPT said:
To properly synchronize access to shared data structures and control the timing of updates using RLock and Condition from the threading module, we need to manage multiple threads that access and modify shared resources. Specifically, RLock will allow threads to safely lock and release resources multiple times, while Condition will help in coordinating the timing of updates between threads (e.g., when to update the display or process data).

Here's how we can modify the previous solution to use RLock and Condition:

Key Concepts:
RLock (Reentrant Lock): This allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times. This is particularly useful when the thread needs to lock the same resource multiple times without deadlocking itself.
Condition: A condition variable is used to allow one or more threads to wait for some condition to be met before proceeding. It provides mechanisms for thread synchronization and coordination.
Updated Solution with RLock and Condition:
import random
import time
import threading
import queue

# Global dictionaries to store temperature readings and averages
latest_temperatures = {}
temperature_averages = {}

# Create a queue to store temperature readings
temperature_queue = queue.Queue()

# Lock and condition for synchronization
lock = threading.RLock()
condition = threading.Condition(lock)

# Function to simulate sensor readings
def simulate_sensor(sensor_id):
    while True:
        # Generate a random temperature between 15 and 40 for each sensor

            latest_temperatures[sensor_id] = temperature
            # Add the temperature to the queue for processing averages
            temperature_queue.put(temperature)
        
        # Notify any waiting threads that a new temperature is available
        with condition:
            condition.notify_all()

Explanation of Key Updates:
RLock for Synchronization:

The RLock object lock is used to ensure that only one thread can access the shared data structures (latest_temperatures and temperature_averages) at a time. This prevents race conditions when multiple threads are updating or reading these shared resources.
with lock: ensures that the lock is acquired and released safely. Any thread that wants to access shared data structures will have to acquire the lock, and it will be released when the block inside the with statement is completed.
Condition for Coordination:

condition is used to notify threads when data has been updated. This helps synchronize the threads that are updating the display and processing temperatures.
The simulate_sensor and process_temperatures functions notify all waiting threads after they update the shared data (latest_temperatures and temperature_averages) by using condition.notify_all().
The update_display function waits for the condition to be notified using condition.wait(). This ensures that the display is updated only when the shared data is ready.
Synchronization Flow:

When the simulate_sensor thread generates new sensor readings, it acquires the lock, updates the temperature data, and then notifies other threads (like update_display) that new data is available.
The process_temperatures thread processes the temperatures to calculate the average and updates the global averages, followed by notifying the update_display thread.
The update_display thread waits for the condition to be notified and then updates the display.
Concurrency:

The simulate_sensor, process_temperatures, and update_display functions run in separate threads, with proper synchronization using RLock and Condition, ensuring that the data is updated safely and consistently across all threads.
Benefits of Using RLock and Condition:
Thread Safety: By using RLock, we ensure that shared resources like latest_temperatures and temperature_averages are not accessed simultaneously by multiple threads, which could cause data corruption.
Controlled Updates: The Condition ensures that the display only updates when the relevant data has been modified, preventing redundant updates and unnecessary processing.
This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple threads need to interact with shared resources, and the timing of updates must be controlled.

                # Calculate the average temperature from readings
                average_temperature = sum(readings) / len(readings)

        with condition:
            condition.notify_all()

        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second before recalculating averages
3. display.py:
This file will manage initializing and updating the display of temperatures.

import time

def initialize_display():
    # Print initial layout with placeholders for temperatures and averages
    print("Current temperatures:")
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming we have 3 sensors
        print(f"Latest Temperature: Sensor {i}: --°C", end=" ")
    print()
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming we want averages for 3 sensors
        print(f"Sensor {i} Average: --°C", end=" ")

def update_display(lock, condition, latest_temperatures, temperature_averages):
    while True:
        # Wait until the data is updated (data becomes available)
        with condition:
            condition.wait()

        # Build the display string with the latest temperatures and averages
        display_str = "Current temperatures:\n"
        
        # Latest temperatures
        display_str += "Latest Temperatures: "
        with lock:
            for i in range(3):  # Assuming we have 3 sensors
                temperature = latest_temperatures.get(i, "--")

        display_str += "\n"
        
        # Sensor averages
        with lock:
            for i in range(3):  # Assuming we want averages for 3 sensors
                average_temperature = temperature_averages.get(f"sensor_{i}_average", "--")
                display_str += f"Sensor {i} Average: {average_temperature}°C "
        
        # Print the updated display (without clearing the console)
        print("\r" + display_str, end="")
        
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second before updating again
4. main.py:
The main file will bring all the functions together, start the threads, and manage the synchronization.

import threading
import time
from threading import RLock, Condition
from sensor import simulate_sensor
from processor import process_temperatures
from display import initialize_display, update_display

# Shared resources
latest_temperatures = {}
temperature_averages = {}

# Lock and condition for synchronization
lock = RLock()
condition = Condition(lock)

def main():
    # Initialize the display layout
    initialize_display()

    # Create and start threads for simulating sensor readings
    sensor_threads = []
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
        sensor_thread = threading.Thread(target=simulate_sensor, args=(i, lock, condition, latest_temperatures))
        sensor_thread.daemon = True  # Ensure the thread exits when the main program exits
        sensor_threads.append(sensor_thread)
        sensor_thread.start()

    # Create and start the thread for processing temperature averages
    processing_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_temperatures, args=(lock, condition, temperature_queue, temperature_averages))
    processing_thread.daemon = True
    processing_thread.start()

    # Create and start the thread for updating the display
    display_thread = threading.Thread(target=update_display, args=(lock, condition, latest_temperatures, temperature_averages))
    display_thread.daemon = True
    display_thread.start()

    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)  # Main thread waits indefinitely
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nProgram interrupted and exiting.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
sensor.py: Contains simulate_sensor, which simulates sensor readings and places them in a shared queue. It also updates the latest_temperatures dictionary with the current temperature.

processor.py: Contains process_temperatures, which processes the temperature readings from the queue to calculate averages.

display.py: Contains functions initialize_display and update_display. The former initializes the layout with placeholders, and the latter updates the display with actual values.

main.py: This is the main program where:

The initialize_display function is called to print the initial layout.
Threads are created for simulating sensors, processing temperatures, and updating the display.
The threads run concurrently, synchronized using RLock and Condition to ensure safe access to shared resources.
Running the Program:
Make sure that all your Python files (sensor.py, processor.py, display.py, main.py) are in the same directory.
From the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your project files and run:
python main.py
This will start the program, simulate the sensors, calculate averages, and update the display in real-time.

what is the branch tree
ChatGPT said:
In Git, a branch tree refers to the structure or hierarchy of branches within a Git repository. It helps visualize how different branches of development evolve from the initial project or from other branches. A branch is essentially a separate line of development in a Git repository, allowing developers to work on features or fixes independently without affecting the main codebase (usually in the main or master branch).

Here's an overview of the branch tree concept in Git:

1. Main Branch (main or master)
The main branch is often considered the primary branch. It’s the branch where the stable and production-ready code is kept.
All feature or bug fix branches typically merge back into the main branch after development is complete.
The master branch was traditionally used in Git, but many repositories now use main instead as the default branch name.
2. Feature Branches
Feature branches are branches created from the main branch to work on new features.
These branches typically have names like feature/login, feature/user-authentication, or feature/new-api.
Once the feature development is completed, the feature branch is merged back into the main branch.
3. Bug Fix Branches
Bug fix branches are similar to feature branches, but they focus on fixing bugs.
These branches could be named like bugfix/issue-102, bugfix/fix-login-error.
After the bug is fixed, the branch is merged back into the main branch.
4. Release Branches
Release branches are created to prepare for a new version or a release of the software.
These branches are used for final testing, bug fixes, and preparing the release.
The naming might be something like release/1.2.0, and it is often created from the main branch.
After release, the changes are merged back into main and tagged with the version number.
5. Hotfix Branches
Hotfix branches are created to quickly address critical bugs in the production code.
These branches are created from the main branch, and the fix is applied directly.
After the fix is implemented, the hotfix branch is merged back into main and release branches if needed.
Branch Tree Example:
Here is an example of what a simple Git branch tree might look like, showcasing the relationships between branches:

*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*  (main branch)
       |   |       |        |   |         |
       |   |       |        |   |         +-- Feature 1
       |   |       |        |   +------------ Feature 2
       |   |       |        |
       |   |       +-------- Bugfix 1
       |   |
       +---+--- Release 1.0.0
Explanation:
The main branch starts at the first commit (shown as *).
The feature branches (Feature 1, Feature 2) were branched from the main branch and eventually merged back after completion.
A bugfix branch (Bugfix 1) was branched from main to fix an issue.
A release branch (Release 1.0.0) was branched to prepare the project for release.
6. Git Branch Commands:
To create a new branch:
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
To list all branches in your repository:
git branch
To merge a branch into the current branch:
git merge feature/feature-name
To delete a branch after merging:
git branch -d feature/feature-name
Branching Strategies:
There are several branching strategies used in Git, such as:

Git Flow: A branching model that defines roles for branches (feature, develop, release, hotfix, etc.).
GitHub Flow: A simpler workflow with feature branches merged directly into main after review.
Trunk-Based Development: All developers work on a single main branch (trunk), with smaller, frequent commits.
Visualizing the Branch Tree:
A branch tree is often visualized through tools like GitHub or GitLab. These platforms provide a graphical interface to see the commit history and how branches have diverged and merged.

Example of a Git Branch Tree:
In a Git repository, you could visualize the branch tree using commands like git log --graph:

git log --graph --oneline --all
This will show a graph of commits and how different branches diverge and merge, helping to visualize the branching structure.

Conclusion:
In summary, a branch tree in Git is a way to visualize how branches have diverged from each other, where they originate from (usually the main branch), and how they are merged back into the main development line. It provides clarity for understanding the flow of development, from features to fixes to releases.

            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nProgram interrupted and exiting.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation of Key Concepts:
Threading: Threads are used to simulate sensors (simulate_sensor), process temperature averages (process_temperatures), and update the display (update_display) concurrently.
Synchronization: The RLock (Reentrant Lock) and Condition objects are used to synchronize access to the shared data structures (latest_temperatures, temperature_averages) between threads.
Daemon Threads: The threads are marked as daemon=True, ensuring that they exit when the main program exits.
Console Updates: The update_display function refreshes the console output in place, avoiding the need to clear the console each time.
Running the Program:
Save each of the files (sensor.py, processor.py, display.py, main.py) inside a folder named src.
Navigate to the folder where main.py is located.
Run the program with:
python src/main.py
The program will simulate sensor readings, process the averages, and update the display in real-time, all running concurrently in separate threads.


You said:
can you give me the simpliest code 
ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Below is a simplified version of the code to fulfill your lab requirements. The program will:

Simulate sensor readings.
Calculate the averages of these readings.
Display them in real-time, updating without clearing the console.
We will use threads for simulating the sensors and processing the data. Synchronization will be done using a Lock to manage access to shared data.

Simplified Code
import random
import time
import threading

# Global shared data
latest_temperatures = {}
temperature_averages = {}

# Lock for synchronizing access to shared data
lock = threading.RLock()
condition = threading.Condition(lock)

# Simulate sensor readings
def simulate_sensor(sensor_id):
    while True:
        temperature = random.randint(15, 40)  # Random temperature between 15°C and 40°C
        with lock:
            latest_temperatures[sensor_id] = temperature
        with condition:
            condition.notify_all()  # Notify other threads that the temperature has been updated
        time.sleep(1)

# Process the temperatures and calculate averages
def process_temperatures():
    while True:
        with lock:
            total = sum(latest_temperatures.values())
            count = len(latest_temperatures)
            if count > 0:
                average = total / count
                for i in range(count):
                    temperature_averages[f"sensor_{i}_average"] = average
        with condition:
            condition.notify_all()  # Notify the display thread to update
        time.sleep(1)

# Initialize the display layout with placeholders
def initialize_display():
    print("Current temperatures:")
    print("Latest Temperatures: ", end="")
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors

    print()

    # Display placeholders for sensor averages
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
        print(f"Sensor {i} Average: --°C ", end="")
    print("\n")

# Update the display with the latest temperatures and averages
def update_display():
    while True:
        with condition:
            condition.wait()  # Wait for data to be updated

        display_str = "Current temperatures:\nLatest Temperatures: "
        with lock:
            for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
                temp = latest_temperatures.get(i, "--")
                display_str += f"Sensor {i}: {temp}°C "

        display_str += "\n"
        with lock:
            for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
                avg = temperature_averages.get(f"sensor_{i}_average", "--")
                display_str += f"Sensor {i} Average: {avg}°C "

        print("\r" + display_str, end="")  # Update the console output
        time.sleep(1)

# Main function to start all the threads
def main():
    initialize_display()

    # Create and start threads for simulate_sensor
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
        threading.Thread(target=simulate_sensor, args=(i,), daemon=True).start()

    # Create and start the processing thread
    threading.Thread(target=process_temperatures, daemon=True).start()

    # Create and start the display update thread
    threading.Thread(target=update_display, daemon=True).start()

    # Keep the main thread running
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
Simulate Sensor: The simulate_sensor function generates a random temperature for each sensor (between 15°C and 40°C) and stores it in the global latest_temperatures dictionary. It updates every second.

Process Temperatures: The process_temperatures function calculates the average of all temperatures stored in latest_temperatures and stores it in the temperature_averages dictionary. It runs every second.

Display: The update_display function continuously prints the latest temperatures and averages to the console. It doesn't clear the console, but it updates the display in place, making it look like real-time updates.

Threading: Each task runs in its own thread:

simulate_sensor for generating temperatures.
process_temperatures for calculating the average.
update_display for printing the updated readings to the console.
Synchronization: The RLock ensures that the shared dictionaries (latest_temperatures, temperature_averages) are updated safely. The Condition is used to coordinate the updates between threads.

Running the Program:
Save the code to a file, say main.py.
Open a terminal and run the program:
python main.py
This simplified version does exactly what was asked in your lab but with less complexity. The program will simulate three sensors, update their temperatures every second, calculate averages, and display the values in real-time without clearing the screen.

                    temperature_averages[f"sensor_{i}_average"] = average
        
        # Notify other threads (e.g., display thread) that the average has been updated
        with condition:
            condition.notify_all()

        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second before processing again
3. src/display.py:
This file contains the initialize_display and update_display functions. The first initializes the display layout, and the second updates it with the latest temperatures and averages.

import time
from threading import RLock, Condition

# Function to initialize the display layout with placeholders
def initialize_display():
    print("Current temperatures:")
    print("Latest Temperatures: ", end="")
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
        print(f"Sensor {i}: --°C ", end="")
    print()

    # Display placeholders for sensor averages
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
        print(f"Sensor {i} Average: --°C ", end="")
    print("\n")

# Function to update the display in place on the console without erasing it
def update_display(lock, condition):
    while True:
        with condition:
            condition.wait()  # Wait for data to be updated

        display_str = "Current temperatures:\nLatest Temperatures: "
        with lock:
            for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
                temp = latest_temperatures.get(i, "--")
                display_str += f"Sensor {i}: {temp}°C "

        display_str += "\n"
        with lock:
            for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
                avg = temperature_averages.get(f"sensor_{i}_average", "--")
                display_str += f"Sensor {i} Average: {avg}°C "

        print("\r" + display_str, end="")  # Update the console output
        time.sleep(1)
4. src/main.py:
This file is the main entry point that integrates all functions and starts the threads for simulating sensors, processing temperatures, and updating the display.

import threading
import time
from threading import RLock, Condition
from sensor import simulate_sensor
from processor import process_temperatures
from display import initialize_display, update_display

# Lock and condition for synchronizing data access between threads
lock = RLock()
condition = Condition(lock)

# Function to run the main program and create threads
def main():
    # Initialize the display layout
    initialize_display()

    # Create and start threads for simulate_sensor
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 sensors
        threading.Thread(target=simulate_sensor, args=(i, lock, condition), daemon=True).start()

    # Create and start the processing thread
    threading.Thread(target=process_temperatures, args=(lock, condition), daemon=True).start()

    # Create and start the display update thread
    threading.Thread(target=update_display, args=(lock, condition), daemon=True).start()

    # Keep the main thread running
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation of the Code:
sensor.py: The simulate_sensor function generates random temperature readings and updates the latest_temperatures dictionary. It uses a RLock for thread-safe access to shared data and a Condition to notify other threads when new data is available.

processor.py: The process_temperatures function computes the average temperature and stores it in the temperature_averages dictionary. It uses the same RLock and Condition to synchronize access and notify other threads.

display.py: The initialize_display function sets up the layout with placeholders, while update_display continuously updates the console with the latest temperatures and averages. The display is updated in place using carriage return (\r), which allows replacing the output without clearing the console.

main.py: The main program initializes the display, starts the threads for simulating sensor readings, processing temperatures, and updating the display, and keeps the main program running with an infinite loop.

How to Run the Program:
Save each file in the src directory as described in the project structure:

sensor.py
processor.py
display.py
main.py
Run the program: Navigate to the directory where main.py is located and run the program with the following command:

python src/main.py
Notes:
The program will run indefinitely, simulating sensor readings, calculating averages, and updating the display every second.
The threads are daemonized, so they will exit when the main program is terminated.
